# "Restaurant reservation system API. This API should allow users to make reservations for a
# restaurant, view available tables, and cancel reservations if needed. Each reservation should
# include the customer's name, reservation date and time (saved in the DB), and the number of
# guests in the party. Additionally, the API should keep track of the available tables and their
# seating capacity.‚Äù
